    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing 
    and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has 
    survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
    into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the 
    release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
    passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
    software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of 
    Lorem Ipsum.
